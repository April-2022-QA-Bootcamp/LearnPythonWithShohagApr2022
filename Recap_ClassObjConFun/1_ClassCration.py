#property in .py file (not in class) so directly we call access it
name="Tofayel"
name="ssss"
print(name)

#in java to crate a class.....we take .class file
# but in python in .py file (we select python file) we create class with 'class' keyword
#in java we have {} as class body but python after we use colon (:) and after colon based on allignment whole area is body clas)

#Following MyClass is the class
class MyClass:
    #propery inside the class....by creating the obj we can access it
    name="sohag"
    age=42
    print(name)#we can also print any propery inside the class without obj cration but only in class area

#creating the obj
obj1=MyClass()
#by obj we are getting the access
print(obj1.name)

#We can have multiple classes in same .py file

class My1class2:
    name = "Lobid"
    age = 42

#we can use pass keyword when we need keep it blank
class MyClass:
    pass
